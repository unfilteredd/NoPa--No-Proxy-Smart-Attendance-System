# 📚 RFID + IoT Based Smart Attendance & Entry System

This project is a **smart classroom entry and attendance solution** built using Arduino and IoT components. It automates the attendance process and ensures secure gate control using RFID, Ultrasonic Sensor, LCD Display, Servo Motor, and a Keypad system for teacher authentication.

## 🔧 Working Logic

1. A student taps their RFID card on the reader.
2. The system checks if the RFID tag is valid.
3. If valid:
   - The gate opens via a servo motor.
   - A 5-second timer starts.
   - During this time, an ultrasonic sensor (placed inside the class) checks if the student has actually entered.
4. After 5 seconds:
   - The gate closes automatically.
   - The student cannot exit back immediately.
5. Attendance is marked for the student only if they enter within the 5-second time frame.

## 🔐 Future Improvements

- Cloud integration for storing attendance data.
- Admin dashboard for real-time attendance.
- SMS/Email alerts on invalid access.
- Face recognition as an additional layer.
